          In our country, most people take up a course in engineering and then, figure out what to do in life. Well, I went through a similar process. When I was in the final year of my B.Tech course, I stumbled upon some well-shot pictures posted by a friend of mine on Facebook. Madhu, my friend, and I had connected through Facebook and he happened to be a fashion photographer based in Mumbai. I went through some of his pictures posted on his Facebook account and was highly inspired by the quality of work he had put across.

          Soon enough, I bought my first camera, a Canon 600D, in 2014. With a camera in my hand, I started experimenting and engaged in a bit of street photography and nature photography. Once I gained some confidence in my abilities and experience, I started covering events in Bengaluru. During this time, I realized that I had discovered my true calling in life. I wanted to pursue a career as a photographer.

          Over the years, I did a bunch of things to hone my skills as a photographer. Between 2017 and 2018, I worked as an intern with Mr. Mike Arrora, one of the most respected fashion photographers in the country. After completing my internship and doing a few projects in Delhi, I registered myself as a photographer with the service platform Urban Clap (now known as Urban Company). Over a period of 6 months, I covered more than 50 shoots in Delhi. I moved to Bengaluru to explore more opportunities. My association with Urban Company continued and I covered more than 300 shoots in 4 years.

          Cameras keep getting upgraded and styles keep changing. As a photographer, therefore, I believe that one should never stop learning. In the last few years, I have attended and been a part of workshops organized by renowned photographers like Shivaji and Illya Nodia, among others. In the year 2019, I invested in a Canon 5D Mark 4, my first full frame camera.

          I have done shoots with popular film personalities like Indraneel Sengupta, Ishita Arun and Shreas Pardiwala. As a photographer, I have reputation of turning up for shoots on time, doing the best for my clients and ensuring that they are happy with the final results. My client turnaround rate is very high. I have worked with several clients repeatedly.
